# PHONETIX – Voice Controlled Robot Workshop 

## Overview

**VoiceControlledBot** is a Bluetooth-based robot control system developed for a robotics workshop conducted by the **Robotics Club of CEG** in collaboration with **ECEA**.
The project demonstrates how an Arduino Nano, an HC-05 Bluetooth module, and an Android application can be integrated to control a robot using **voice commands** and **manual controls**.


## Project Components

### Arduino Firmware

* Main robot control code
* Bluetooth configuration sketch for setting module name and password

### Android App (MIT App Inventor)

* Voice command recognition
* Manual directional buttons
* Bluetooth device scanning and connection


## Getting Started

1. Upload **BluetoothConfig** sketch to configure module name and password.
2. Upload the main **VoiceControlledBot** firmware to Arduino Nano.
3. Install the Android `.apk` from the `android_app` folder.
4. Pair with the Bluetooth module and start controlling the robot.
